# About me
## My interests
- I love sports, especially basketball and football which are the two sports I played during my life. When I'm not doing that, I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with my friends.
## Websites I recommend
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - YouTube is interesting to me because it has many different types of videos you can watch. You can find videos to educate yourself on a subject you're struggling with, you can watch highlights of sports games, and you can watch video tutorials if you want to learn something new.
- [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest) - Quizlet can help students practice, test, and better their understanding of a topic because of the many learning ways the website has to offer.
